There are two levels, the only difference is the layout, the starting money, and the HP which you start with.

You have to stop the enemies getting to the red portal by building towers.

There are two types of enemies,
 - Regular: These (green) enemies progressively get stronger throughout the game, and each one destroyed will
            reward you with 1 point and 1 coin for building more towers.
 - Boss:    These (yellow) enemies also get stronger throughout the game, they have double the hp of one regular enemy,
            and they reward more points and coins as well. As the game goes on longer, bosses will reward more
            and more coins/points.

There are three types of towers you can build:
 - Basic:   	These towers fire once per second, and deal one damage. They have a resonable range, and only cost 5 coins.
 - Machine Gun: These towers fire 6 times per second, and deal one damage. They have a much shorter range and cost 40 coins.
 - AoE :	These towers fire slightly less than once per second. They fire an AoE around them, at a reasonable range dealing
		1 damage. They cost 25 coins.
